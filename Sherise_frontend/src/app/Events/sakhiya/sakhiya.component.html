          Unveiling the hidden challenges surrounding menstruation, shedding light on disparities, and advocating for change through Sakhi. Our mission is to break the silence and dismantle the stigma surrounding menstruation in rural areas through comprehensive education and community engagement.

        <p>
          Our approach includes community mobilization, the creation of informative and engaging IEC (Information, Education, and Communication) materials, and comprehensive education sessions.

      <p>
        Around 500 million women across the world, including a significant number of school girls, do not have access to private spaces and menstrual products that would enable them to manage their periods in a dignified way. In many regions across the world, this challenge is further aggravated by silence, restrictive sociocultural norms, and taboos around menstruation.
      </p>
      <p>
        India is no exception to this and still needs to address poor MHMM practices despite government and non-government interventions having increased. The lack of adequate menstrual health management has a profound impact on the education and well-being of school girls.
