            <h2 class="subheading mt-1">how does nutrition impact your period? </h2>
        <h4>
            The best way to manage your food intake to ensure overall menstrual health is by understanding how different foods affect your body during the various phases of the menstrual cycle. 

            The menstrual cycle can be broken down into four different phases — the menstruation phase, follicular phase, ovulation phase, and the luteal phase. A balanced diet during periods can play
             a big role in optimising these phases and improving your overall quality of life.  </h4>
        <h2 class="subheading mt-2">what should you eat during the menstruation phase? </h2>
        <h4>
            During this phase, your body experiences blood loss, exhaustion, cramping, moodiness, and more. The essential nutrients to look out for during this time are iron, vitamin C, and magnesium. When we bleed, we lose somewhere between 
            40-60 ml of blood, and along with that, we lose iron.Iron plays a key role in energy production, oxygen transport, and immunity building. To replenish your supply, you need to eat more iron-rich foods during your period, especially during the menstruation phase.  </h4>
      
            <h2 class="subheading mt-2">what should you eat during the follicular phase? </h2>
            <h4>During ovulation, oestrogen levels are at their peak, with the luteinising hormone (LH) triggering the release of an egg from your ovaries. During this phase, you may feel like you’re at your best, and have all the motivation in the world to get things done! 

                Vitamin D and zinc are important nutrients to include in your diet during this phase. Foods like mushrooms, salmon, sardines, and eggs are great sources of Vitamin D.  Not only will they help boost your immune system, but also prepare your body for the next phase of the cycle. </h4>
            
            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">what should you eat during the luteal phase? </h2>
            <h4>The luteal phase can be divided into two stages—the first few days when you’re still feeling good, and the second half, when the lack of fertilisation leads to a drop in hormonal levels and brings on the PMS symptoms. 

                During this phase, healthy fats and Vitamin B6 are essential! Foods such as avocado, wild salmon, sesame, and sunflower seeds contain healthy fats that support skin health and prevent breakouts.

            </h4>
            <h2 class="subheading mt-2">What should you eat during the follicular phase?</h2>
            <h4>
                The follicular phase is a time of increased energy and metabolism, making it important to focus on nutrient-rich foods that support overall health and hormone balance.

                - **Vitamin D:** Foods like fatty fish, egg yolks, and fortified dairy products can help maintain healthy levels of vitamin D.
                - **Zinc:** Include foods such as pumpkin seeds, cashews, and whole grains to support immune health and cellular function.
                - **Protein:** Lean meats, tofu, and legumes help sustain energy and support muscle health.
                - **Antioxidants:** Berries, nuts, and green tea can help reduce oxidative stress and support overall health.
            </h4>

            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">What should you eat during the ovulation phase?</h2>
            <h4>
                During ovulation, your body is preparing for potential fertilization, so focus on foods that support reproductive health and energy levels.

                - **Folate:** Leafy greens, avocados, and beans provide folate, which is important for cell division and fertility.
                - **Healthy Fats:** Avocado, olive oil, and nuts support hormone production and overall reproductive health.
                - **B Vitamins:** Whole grains, eggs, and legumes help maintain energy levels and support hormone regulation.
                - **Hydration:** Staying hydrated helps maintain optimal bodily functions and energy levels.
