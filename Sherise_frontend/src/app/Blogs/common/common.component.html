            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">Common Repercussions of Unhealthy Menstrual Practices</h2>
            <h4>Maintaining proper menstrual hygiene is essential for overall health and well-being during periods. Neglecting menstrual hygiene can lead to various health issues and complications. Here are some common repercussions of unhealthy menstrual practices:</h4>
            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">1. Infections:</h2>
            <h4><strong>Bacterial Vaginosis:</strong> Poor hygiene can disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina, leading to bacterial vaginosis. Symptoms include itching, unusual discharge, and an unpleasant odor.</h4>
            <h4><strong>Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):</strong> Improper hygiene practices can introduce bacteria into the urinary tract, causing infections. Symptoms include a burning sensation during urination, frequent urges to urinate, and pelvic pain.</h4>
            <h4><strong>Yeast Infections:</strong> Excess moisture and improper cleaning can create an environment conducive to yeast growth, resulting in itching, redness, and thick discharge.</h4>
            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">2. Skin Irritation and Rashes:</h2>
            <h4>Prolonged use of sanitary products without changing can cause skin irritation, rashes, and even sores. The damp environment can lead to chafing and discomfort.</h4>
            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">3. Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs):</h2>
            <h4>Neglecting menstrual hygiene can increase the risk of RTIs, which affect the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. Symptoms may include pelvic pain, abnormal discharge, and fever.</h4>
            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">4. Increased Risk of Cervical Cancer:</h2>
            <h4>Some studies suggest that poor menstrual hygiene practices may contribute to an increased risk of cervical cancer due to persistent infections and inflammation.</h4>
            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">5. Awareness and Education:</h2>
            <h4>Educate yourself and others about the importance of menstrual hygiene and the potential health risks of neglecting it.
            By understanding and addressing these common repercussions, you can prioritize menstrual hygiene and maintain optimal health during your period. Always prioritize your health and well-being during menstruation.</h4>
            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">6. Menstrual Odor:</h2>
        <h4>Improper hygiene can result in unpleasant menstrual odor. Regular changing of sanitary products and proper cleaning can help manage and prevent this issue.</h4>
        
        <h2 class="subheading mt-3">7. Reduced Quality of Life:</h2>
        <h4>Poor menstrual hygiene can impact daily activities and reduce the quality of life. Discomfort, pain, and frequent infections can affect work, social activities, and overall well-being.</h4>
        
        <h2 class="subheading mt-3">8. Complications in Pregnancy:</h2>
        <h4>Unhealthy menstrual practices can lead to complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can affect fertility and pregnancy outcomes.</h4>
