            <h5 class="head2 mt-1">Common Repercussions of Unhealthy Menstrual Practices</h5>
            <p>Maintaining proper menstrual hygiene is essential for overall health and well-being during periods. Neglecting menstrual hygiene can lead to various health issues and complications. Here are some common repercussions of unhealthy menstrual practices:</p>
            <h5 class="head2 mt-2">1. Infections:</h5>
            <p><strong>Bacterial Vaginosis:</strong> Poor hygiene can disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina, leading to bacterial vaginosis. Symptoms include itching, unusual discharge, and an unpleasant odor.</p>
            <p><strong>Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):</strong> Improper hygiene practices can introduce bacteria into the urinary tract, causing infections. Symptoms include a burning sensation during urination, frequent urges to urinate, and pelvic pain.</p>
            <p><strong>Yeast Infections:</strong> Excess moisture and improper cleaning can create an environment conducive to yeast growth, resulting in itching, redness, and thick discharge.</p>
            <h5 class="head2 mt-3">2. Skin Irritation and Rashes:</h5>
            <p>Prolonged use of sanitary products without changing can cause skin irritation, rashes, and even sores. The damp environment can lead to chafing and discomfort.</p>
            <h5 class="head2 mt-3">3. Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs):</h5>
            <p>Neglecting menstrual hygiene can increase the risk of RTIs, which affect the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. Symptoms may include pelvic pain, abnormal discharge, and fever.</p>
            <h5 class="head2 mt-3">4. Increased Risk of Cervical Cancer:</h5>
            <p>Some studies suggest that poor menstrual hygiene practices may contribute to an increased risk of cervical cancer due to persistent infections and inflammation.</p>
            <h5 class="head2 mt-3">5. Awareness and Education:</h5>
            <p>Educate yourself and others about the importance of menstrual hygiene and the potential health risks of neglecting it.</p>
            <p>By understanding and addressing these common repercussions, you can prioritize menstrual hygiene and maintain optimal health during your period. Always prioritize your health and well-being during menstruation.</p>
