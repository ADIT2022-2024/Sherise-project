          Why Am I In A Good Mood After My Period Starts?
        </h5>
        <br />
        <p>
          You're likely well acquainted with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), the
          set of symptoms that can occur in the days leading up to your
          period. But have you ever noticed that once your period actually
          starts, the clouds seem to part, and you suddenly feel a whole lot
          better?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It's not just your mind playing tricks on you. There's actually a
          scientific reason for why you might feel in a good mood after your
          period starts and why your mood can seem to change throughout the
          month.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It all relates to hormones and how they shift once your period
          starts. Let's look at hormones throughout your cycle, especially
          around your period, and how they can affect your mood.
          In this article, we’ll take a closer look at how heavy periods can
          cause anemia, the symptoms to watch out for, and the treatment
          options.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5 class="head2 mt-2">Menstrual Cycle 101</h5>
        <br />
        <p>
          Your menstrual cycle is controlled by two main sex hormones:
          estrogen and progesterone (you’ll want to see that other article for
          how your brain is involved). These hormones fluctuate throughout
          your cycle, with estrogen levels rising in the first half and
          peaking around ovulation and progesterone levels rising in the
          second half and peaking just before your period.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The first phase of your cycle is called the follicular phase because
          it's when the follicle that contains the egg develops.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The second phase of your cycle is called the luteal phase. The egg
          is released, and the follicle becomes the corpus luteum, which
          produces progesterone and estrogen.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5 class="head2 mt-2">Period Mood Swings, Both Happy and Sad</h5>
        <br />
        <p>
          Some people notice an immediate change when they start their period,
          while others need to wait a few days for the mood-boosting effects
          of estrogen to start kicking in. And some just feel not-so-great for
          the entire period.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          It's also worth noting that not everyone experiences premenstrual
          syndrome (PMS), and not everyone experiences the same symptoms if
          they do have PMS. And the same is true for premenstrual dysphoric
          disorder (PMDD)
        </p>

          Iron deficiency anemia is more common among women than men. Risk
          factors for iron deficiency anemia among women include:

        <h5 class="head2 mt-2">
          Hormone Levels During Menstrual Cycle Phases
        </h5>
        <p>
          You're not alone if you're someone who usually feels pretty good
          during your period or right after it starts. In fact, there's a
          scientific reason for why you might feel this way. When hormone
          levels increase during the follicular phase of your cycle, it can
          positively affect your mood.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Let's take a closer look</p>
        <br />
        <h5 class="head2 mt-2 fphase">The Follicular Phase: Mood Enhancer</h5>
        <br />
        <p>
          The follicular phase tends to be when you may notice your mood is
          lighter and you have more energy. It lasts around two weeks until
          ovulation.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Day one of your follicular phase is the first day of your period.
          So, even though estrogen levels are low at the start of your period,
          they don’t stay there for long. Estrogen starts to rise as the
          follicular phase progresses. Estrogen (plus follicle-stimulating
          hormone, FSH) is needed to develop the follicle that contains the
          egg and thickens the uterine lining in preparation for the
          implantation of a fertilized egg.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As estrogen levels increase, you might notice a positive effect on
          your mood. It may take a few days, but those symptoms of PMS
          irritability or low mood start to dissipate once your period starts.
          By the time your period ends, you'll (hopefully) feel more social
          and happy.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h5 class="head2 mt-2 fphase">
          The Ovulatory Phase is Your Menstrual Cycle Midpoin
        </h5>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ovulation is the release of an egg from the ovary and usually occurs
          midway through your cycle. A sudden rise in estrogen levels plus a
          surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers ovulation. This is the
          point in your cycle when the body is prepped to make a baby (even if
          it's not in your plans).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Some people may feel temporarily low mood when estrogen drops back
          down from its pre-ovulation spike, but since it climbs again a few
          days after ovulation, it's usually short-lived.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div>
          <img src="/assets/images/blog/menstrual-cycle.jpg" alt="" height="400px" width="650" />
        </div>

        <h5 class="head2 mt-2 fphase">
          The Luteal Phase Can Lead to Low Mood
        </h5>
        <br />
        <p>
          After ovulation, the corpus luteum, the temporary endocrine
          structure left behind in the ovary following ovulation, begins
          producing progesterone. This phase is called the luteal phase and
          lasts for the remainder of your cycle until you get your period.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Progesterone levels rise for the first half of the luteal phase to
          prepare for a possible pregnancy. You may feel relaxed and sleep
          better as progesterone increases because it can stimulate calming
          neurotransmitters in the brain.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But as you get closer to your period, things can change. If there is
          no HCG (the pregnancy hormone) available to keep the corpus luteum
          producing progesterone, it will degrade. This triggers the fall of
          progesterone and estrogen, which is normal if there has been no
          implantation of a fertilized egg (pregnancy). Serotonin can also
          decline with the dip in estrogen. Serotonin has been linked to low
          moods and symptoms of depression.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          While the above can be characterized by mild shifts in mood,
          motivation, and energy, which is normal, there are situations where
          mood changes are not considered normal in the luteal phase.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h5 class="head2 mt-2 fphase">PMS and PMDD in the Luteal Phase</h5>
        <br />
        <p>
          PMS or Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) occurs towards the end
          of the luteal phase, right before your period starts. PMDD is much
          more severe than PMS, although both should be taken seriously by
          your provider.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          In certain cases, PMS can be an issue of too little progesterone,
          leaving estrogen to stimulate cell receptors. If you’re struggling
          with mood and hormone symptoms, I encourage you to grab my free
          Hormone Balancing Starter Kit to help you get a handle on those
          symptoms.

        <p style="color: rgb(68, 63, 63)">
          Symptoms of PMDD can look like PMS, but the critical difference is
          the severity and duration of symptoms like:
