          Why Am I In A Good Mood After My Period Starts?
        </h2>
        <br />
        <h4>
          You're likely well acquainted with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), the
          set of symptoms that can occur in the days leading up to your
          period. But have you ever noticed that once your period actually
          starts, the clouds seem to part, and you suddenly feel a whole lot
          better?
        </h4>
        <br />
        <h4>
          It's not just your mind playing tricks on you. There's actually a
          scientific reason for why you might feel in a good mood after your
          period starts and why your mood can seem to change throughout the
          month.
        </h4>
        <br />
        <h4>
          It all relates to hormones and how they shift once your period
          starts. Let's look at hormones throughout your cycle, especially
          around your period, and how they can affect your mood.
          In this article, we’ll take a closer look at how heavy periods can
          cause anemia, the symptoms to watch out for, and the treatment
          options.
        </h4>
        <br />
        <h2 class="subheading mt-3">>Menstrual Cycle 101</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Your menstrual cycle is controlled by two main sex hormones:
          estrogen and progesterone (you’ll want to see that other article for
          how your brain is involved). These hormones fluctuate throughout
          your cycle, with estrogen levels rising in the first half and
          peaking around ovulation and progesterone levels rising in the
          second half and peaking just before your period.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>
          The first phase of your cycle is called the follicular phase because
          it's when the follicle that contains the egg develops.
        </h4>
        <br />
        <h4>
          The second phase of your cycle is called the luteal phase. The egg
          is released, and the follicle becomes the corpus luteum, which
          produces progesterone and estrogen.
        </h4>

        <h2 class="subheading mt-3">Period Mood Swings, Both Happy and Sad</h2>
        <br />
        <h4>
          Some people notice an immediate change when they start their period,
          while others need to wait a few days for the mood-boosting effects
          of estrogen to start kicking in. And some just feel not-so-great for
          the entire period.

        <br />

        <h4>
          It's also worth noting that not everyone experiences premenstrual
          syndrome (PMS), and not everyone experiences the same symptoms if
          they do have PMS. And the same is true for premenstrual dysphoric
          disorder (PMDD)
