            <h5 class="head2 mt-1">Home Remedies for Menorrhagia</h5>
        <p>
            Answering questions like “how to reduce bleeding during periods?” might be a little difficult and one that we would suggest you ask help for from a health professional, but we can certainly offer some tips to help you manage your menstrual cramps effectively. We have put together some simple home remedies for women with menorrhagia (aka heavy flow period) that you can try from the comfort of your home. Let’s dig in, shall we?
        </p>
        <h5 class="head2 mt-2">1. Superfoods for Superwomen</h5>
        <p>
            It may be difficult to get your hands on exotic, herbal ingredients, so try including these readily available superfoods from your kitchen into your diet, which is surely the best home remedy for heavy periods:
        </p>
        <ul class="blog-con">
            <li><strong>Turmeric:</strong> Having a warm cup of water infused with turmeric soothes cramps by increasing the blood flow to the uterus and pelvic region.</li>
            <li><strong>Seeds:</strong> Eating soaked fenugreek, cumin, and flax seeds during periods has shown to reduce inflammation and pain considerably.</li>
            <li><strong>Tea:</strong> Peppermint, chamomile, and tea with black pepper have pain-relieving and calming effects which instantly put you in a good mood.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can consume these foods raw, soaked in water, or with your meals, and adding these to your diet will make a huge difference. While the above-mentioned food items are ideal home remedies for heavy periods,
             avoiding certain foods will also help regulate your pain better.</p>
            
            <h5 class="head2 mt-3">2.Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate</h5>
            <p>Have you ever felt like a bloated puffer fish on your period? Well, you are not alone! One of the best home remedies to combat bloating is: Drink more water! While you are menstruating, hormonal changes cause your body to retain more salt and water, which could lead to bloating. So bottoms up!</p>
            
            <h5 class="head2 mt-3">  3.Stay Active</h5>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief, staying active is a natural way to improve blood circulation and uplift your mood. Light cardio exercises like walking or doing yoga will increase your heartbeat and release a rush of endorphins in your body. If that’s not your thing, you could give yourself an acupuncture massage with your favourite essential oils, which is also a great home remedy for relief from heavy period pain!</p>
            
            <h5 class="head2 mt-3">4.Self-Care Is the Best Care</h5>
            <p>Wouldn’t you love to escape from a world of pain and spend time doing things that make you happy & divert your mind from the heavy flow period? Well, you can! You could listen to your favourite tunes in the comfiest of sweats, light a scented candle or even take that relaxing bubble bath you’ve
                 been thinking about all week. The sky’s the limit!</p>
   
                 <h5 class="head2 mt-3"> 4.Do-It-Yourself Time</h5>
                 <p>Sure, masturbating on your period can get quite messy, but it’s not without benefits of its own. When you orgasm, your body releases certain hormones which act as natural pain killers. Not only is it super fun, but it also helps alleviate your mood. So, go ahead and enjoy yourself!</p>
