            <h4>
                Maintaining good menstrual hygiene is crucial for comfort and health during periods. Here are some practical tips and practices you can follow:
            </h4>

            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">1. Proper Hygiene Products:</h2>
            <h4>
                <strong>Sanitary Napkins or Tampons:</strong> Use high-quality sanitary pads or tampons that suit your flow. Change them every 4-6 hours to prevent bacterial growth and odor.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                <strong>Menstrual Cups:</strong> If comfortable, consider using menstrual cups, which are eco-friendly and can be reused after proper cleaning. They offer a longer duration of use and reduce waste.
            </h4>

            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">2. Regular Changing:</h2>
            <h4>
                Regularly change sanitary products to prevent bacterial infections. Wash your hands before and after handling sanitary products to maintain hygiene.
            </h4>

            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">3. Cleanliness:</h2>
            <h4>
                <strong>Gentle Cleansing:</strong> Clean the genital area gently with mild soap and water during showers or when changing sanitary products. Avoid vigorous scrubbing.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                <strong>Avoid Irritants:</strong> Avoid using harsh soaps, douches, or scented products near the vaginal area, as they can disrupt the natural pH balance and cause irritation.
            </h4>

            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">4. Relaxation Techniques:</h2>
            <h4>
                <strong>Deep Breathing:</strong> Practice deep breathing exercises or meditation to reduce stress and promote relaxation during your period.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                <strong>Yoga and Stretching:</strong> Gentle yoga poses and stretching can help alleviate cramps and improve blood circulation. Poses like child’s pose and cat-cow can be especially beneficial.
            </h4>

            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">5. Seek Medical Advice:</h2>
            <h4>
                If you experience unusually heavy bleeding, severe pain, or any other concerning symptoms, consult a healthcare professional for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. It’s important to address any abnormalities promptly.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                By following these practices, you can effectively manage menstrual hygiene at home and ensure a comfortable and healthy period experience. Always prioritize your health and well-being during menstruation.
            </h4>
            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">6. Hydration:</h2>
            <h4>
                Drink plenty of water throughout your period. Staying hydrated helps reduce bloating and can alleviate discomfort. Herbal teas like ginger or peppermint can also soothe cramps and improve digestion.
            </h4>
        
            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">7. Balanced Diet:</h2>
            <h4>
                Maintain a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Foods high in iron and magnesium, such as leafy greens and nuts, can help replenish nutrients lost during menstruation and reduce fatigue.
            </h4>
        
            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">8. Proper Disposal of Sanitary Products:</h2>
            <h4>
                Dispose of used sanitary products properly. Wrap them in toilet paper or use disposal bags before placing them in a bin. Avoid flushing sanitary products down the toilet, as they can cause blockages and environmental harm.
            </h4>
        
            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">9. Exercise Regularly:</h2>
            <h4>
                Light to moderate exercise can help reduce menstrual cramps and boost your mood. Activities like walking, swimming, or cycling can improve circulation and ease discomfort. However, listen to your body and rest when needed.
            </h4>
        
            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">10. Mental Well-being:</h2>
            <h4>
                Pay attention to your mental health during your period. Hormonal changes can affect your mood, so take time for self-care. Engage in activities that relax you, such as reading, listening to music, or spending time with loved ones.
            </h4>
        
            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">11. Use Comfortable Clothing:</h2>
            <h4>
                Wear loose, comfortable clothing during your period. Tight clothing can cause discomfort and exacerbate bloating. Opt for breathable fabrics like cotton to stay cool and comfortable.
            </h4>
        
            <h4>
                By following these practices, you can effectively manage menstrual hygiene at home and ensure a comfortable and healthy period experience. Always prioritize your health and well-being during menstruation.
