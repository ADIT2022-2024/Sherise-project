            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">Polycystic ovary syndrome  </h2>
        <h4>
            Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition in which the ovaries produce an abnormal amount of androgens, male sex hormones that are usually present in women in small amounts. The name polycystic ovary syndrome describes the numerous small cysts (fluid-filled sacs) that form in the ovaries. However, some women with this disorder do not have cysts, while some women without the disorder do develop cysts
        </h4>
        <h2 class="subheading mt-3">What are the symptoms of PCOS?</h2>
        <h4>
            The symptoms of PCOS may include:
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>-Missed periods, irregular periods, or very light periods</li>
            <li>-Ovaries that are large or have many cysts</li>
            <li>-Excess body hair, including the chest, stomach, and back (hirsutism)</li>
            <li>-Weight gain, especially around the belly (abdomen)</li>
            <li>-Acne or oily skin</li>
            <li>-Male-pattern baldness or thinning hair</li>
            <li>-Small pieces of excess skin on the neck or armpits (skin tags)</li>
            <li>-Dark or thick skin patches on the back of the neck, in the armpits, and under the breasts</li>
        </ul><br>
            
            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">What is the cause of PCOS?</h2>
            <h4>The exact cause of PCOS is not clear. Many women with PCOS have insulin resistance. This means the body can't use insulin well. Insulin levels build up in the body and may cause higher androgen levels. Obesity can also increase insulin levels and make PCOS symptoms worse.

            </h4>
            <h4>PCOS may also run in families. It's common for sisters or a mother and daughter to have PCOS.</h4>
            
            <h2 class="subheading mt-3" >How is PCOS diagnosed?</h2>
            <h4>Your health care provider will ask about your medical history and your symptoms. You will also have a physical exam. This will likely include a pelvic exam. This exam checks the health of your reproductive organs, both inside and outside your body.</h4>
            <h4>Some of the symptoms of PCOS are like those caused by other health problems. Because of this, you may also have tests such as:</h4>
            <ul class="blog-con">
                <li><strong>Ultrasound:</strong>This test uses sound waves and a computer to create images of blood vessels, tissues, and organs. This test is used to look at the size of the ovaries and see if they have cysts. The test can also look at the thickness of the lining of the uterus (endometrium).</li>
                <li><strong>Blood tests.</strong>These look for high levels of androgens and other hormones. Your health care provider may also check your blood glucose levels. And you may have your cholesterol and triglyceride levels checked.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">How is PCOS treated?</h2>
            <h4>Treatment for PCOS depends on a number of factors. These may include your age, how severe your symptoms are, and your overall health. The type of treatment may also depend on whether you want to become pregnant in the future.</h4>
            <h4>If you do plan to become pregnant, your treatment may include: </h4> 
           <ul class="blog-con">
            <li><strong>A change in diet and activity.</strong>A healthy diet and more physical activity can help you lose weight and reduce your symptoms. They can also help your body use insulin more efficiently, lower blood glucose levels, and may help you ovulate.</li>
            <li><strong>Medications to cause ovulation</strong>Medications can help the ovaries to release eggs normally. These medications also have certain risks. They can increase the chance for a multiple birth (twins or more). And they can cause ovarian hyperstimulation. This is when the ovaries release too many hormones. It can cause symptoms such as abdominal bloating and pelvic pain.</li>
               </ul>
            <h4>If you do not plan to become pregnant, your treatment may include:</h4>       
            <ul class="blog-con">
                <li><strong>Birth control pills.</strong>These help to control menstrual cycles, lower androgen levels, and reduce acne.</li>
                <li><strong>Diabetes medication. </strong>This is often used to lower insulin resistance in PCOS. It may also help reduce androgen levels, slow hair growth, and help you ovulate more regularly.</li>
                <li><strong>A change in diet and activity.</strong> A healthy diet and more physical activity can help you lose weight and reduce your symptoms. They can also help your body use insulin more efficiently, lower blood glucose levels, and may help you ovulate.
                <li><strong>Medications to treat other symptoms</strong>Some medications can help reduce hair growth or acne.</li>
                
            </ul>                         
            <h2 class="subheading mt-3" >What are the complications of PCOS?</h2>
            <h4>Women with PCOS are more likely to develop certain serious health problems. These include type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, problems with the heart and blood vessels, and uterine cancer. Women with PCOS often have problems with their ability to get pregnant (fertility).</h4>
            <h2 class="subheading mt-3">Lifestyle Management Tips</h2>
            <h4>Managing PCOS often involves making lifestyle changes that can help alleviate symptoms and reduce the risk of complications:</h4>
            <ul class="blog-con">
                <li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight:</strong> Even a small weight loss (5% to 10% of your body weight) can improve symptoms and increase the effectiveness of medications.</li>
                <li><strong>Choose healthy foods:</strong> Focus on whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive amounts of refined carbohydrates.</li>
                <li><strong>Exercise regularly:</strong> Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week. This can help lower insulin levels and keep your weight in check.</li>
                <li><strong>Manage stress:</strong> Chronic stress can worsen hormonal imbalances. Practice stress-reducing activities such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.</li>
                <li><strong>Quit smoking:</strong> Smoking increases androgen levels, which can worsen PCOS symptoms.</li>
            </ul>
