                        <p>Proper menstrual hygiene is vital for maintaining women's health and comfort during
                            menstruation. It includes
                            essential practices such as regularly changing sanitary products like pads, tampons, or
                            menstrual cups every 4-6
                            hours to prevent bacterial growth and odor. Washing hands thoroughly with soap and water
                            before and after handling
                            these products is equally important to minimize the spread of bacteria and maintain
                            personal hygiene standards.

                        </p>
                        <p>Additionally, cleaning the genital area with mild soap and water helps remove menstrual
                            fluid and bacteria, reducing
                            the risk of irritation and infections. These hygiene habits not only promote physical
                            health by preventing urinary
                            tract infections (UTIs), vaginal infections, and skin irritations but also support
                            mental well-being by ensuring
                            comfort and confidence during menstruation. By adhering to these straightforward yet
                            critical practices, women can
                            effectively manage their menstrual hygiene, ensuring overall health and well-being
                            throughout their menstrual
                            cycles.

                                Menstrual hygiene products cater to diverse needs during menstruation. Sanitary
                                pads, available in disposable and
                                reusable forms, absorb menstrual blood effectively. Tampons, inserted into the

                                prevent leaks and maintain hygiene. Menstrual cups, reusable and inserted into the

                                blood, offer an eco-friendly alternative with longer wear times. Similarly,

                                the vaginal canal, function similarly to cups and provide increased comfort and

                                Failure to change sanitary
                                products regularly can promote bacterial growth, potentially causing infections like
                                UTIs or vaginal infections.
                                Poor hygiene practices, such as inadequate hand washing before and after handling
                                menstrual products, increase the
                                risk of spreading bacteria and infections. Improper disposal methods, such as
                                flushing products or improper disposal
                                in open bins, can contribute to environmental pollution and sanitation issues.</p>
                            <p>

                                Socially, inadequate menstrual hygiene may lead to embarrassment, discomfort, and
                                reduced confidence, particularly
                                if leaks or odors occur. Emotionally, the stigma surrounding menstruation can be
                                exacerbated by poor hygiene
                                practices, impacting overall well-being. Therefore, maintaining proper menstrual

                                changes, thorough hand washing, and appropriate disposal methods is essential for

                                sanitary products regularly to

                                Syndrome (TSS) is important; using tampons with the lowest absorbency necessary and
                                changing them frequently can
                                help mitigate this risk. Additionally, monitoring for any allergies or sensitivities

                                products, such as pads or tampons, is essential. Being attentive to these factors
