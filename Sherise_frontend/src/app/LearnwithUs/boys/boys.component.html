                <p>No, it is never acceptable to make fun of someone because of their menstrual cycle. Menstruation is a natural and normal bodily process that affects half of the population, and it is important to respect and support people who experience it. Making fun of someone who menstruates can be hurtful, and embarrassing, and can contribute to feelings of shame and stigma around periods. Boys can play an important role in breaking down these harmful attitudes and promoting understanding and acceptance of menstruation.</p>

                <p>Yes, it is important for boys to talk about periods at home so that they can better understand and support their female family members or friends who menstruate. This can help to break down any stigma or shame surrounding periods and promote open and honest communication about menstrual health and hygiene. It is also important for boys to learn about periods as a natural and normal bodily process, and to recognize that menstruation is not something to be ashamed of or hidden.</p>

                <p>As a young school-going boy, your role in making menstruation normal is to treat it as a normal and natural process that happens to half of the world's population. You can start by educating yourself about menstruation and understanding that it is a natural process that occurs in girls and women. You can also make an effort to be supportive of your female classmates, friends, and family members who may be experiencing menstruation. This can include being understanding and respectful if they need to take a break or miss school due to menstrual cramps or other symptoms. Additionally, you can help to break down the stigma surrounding menstruation by not participating in or laughing at jokes or teasing related to it. You can also encourage others to do the same and speak out against discrimination or negative attitudes towards menstruation. By treating menstruation as a normal and natural part of life, you can help to create a more accepting and supportive community for everyone.</p>
